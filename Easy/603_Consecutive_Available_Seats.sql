/* Table: Cinema

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| seat_id     | int  |
| free        | bool |
+-------------+------+
seat_id is an auto-increment primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates whether the ith seat is free or not. 1 means free while 0 means occupied.
 

Write an SQL query to report all the consecutive available seats in the cinema.

Return the result table ordered by seat_id in ascending order.

The test cases are generated so that more than two seats are consecutively available.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Cinema table:
+---------+------+
| seat_id | free |
+---------+------+
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
+---------+------+
Output: 
+---------+
| seat_id |
+---------+
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
+---------+ */

-- Solution:
SELECT DISTINCT c1.seat_id
FROM Cinema c1
JOIN Cinema c2
    ON ABS(c1.seat_id - c2.seat_id) = 1
    AND c1.free = 1
    AND c2.free = 1
ORDER BY c1.seat_id

# ABS() is necessary because the first free seat should also be included 
# in our list, but without ABS(), we wouldn't be able to count the first
# empty seat.
